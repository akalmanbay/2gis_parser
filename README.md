# 2gis_parser

### There are two ipynb files with help of which we parser data from 2gis:
#### 1. 2gis parser for links
Here we get the links to each object of defined categories and subcategories by going through the pages simulating clicks. Otherwise, 2gis does not allow to go to the n-th page of categories by link.

#### 2. 2gis parser for objects via their links
In this file, we parser data via links to objects sorted by their categories and subcategories.
